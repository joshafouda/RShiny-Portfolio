    <h2 class="featurette-heading">What REALLY<br><span class="text-muted">is Data Science?</span></h2>
    <p class="lead">Data Science over here, Data Science over there !!! The term “Data Science” is currently on everyone's lips. You hear it everywhere. But why such a fuss? Is this just a passing fad or is it something really serious? <a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordionOne" href="#collapseOne">Read more&hellip;</a></p>

              <blockquote class="blockquote">According to IBM, &ldquo;Data science is a multidisciplinary approach to extracting actionable insights from the large and ever-increasing volumes of data collected and created by today’s organizations. Data science encompasses preparing data for analysis and processing, performing advanced data analysis, and presenting the results to reveal patterns and enable stakeholders to draw informed conclusions.&rdquo;</blockquote>
              <p>We are in the era of Big Data. The world generates billions of billions of data of all types every day in all sectors (Health, Engineering, Finance, Sport, Industry, Environment, Agriculture, etc.). The exploitation of this data allows the development of increasingly efficient artificial intelligences which help us to solve problems of daily life. Unfortunately, according to Google, as of today, we are mining only 1% of all the amount of data available in the world. As a result, data science represents a huge niche of opportunities of all kinds. Anyone who is able to analyze and add value to data has a very competitive advantage in the job market and in the business world. Big Data combined with other factors such as the computing power of today's computers, highly sophisticated algorithms and open-source tools is the cornerstone of Data Science. Thanks to Big Data, Data Science is a discipline in its own right.</p>
              <p>Data Science is at the intersection of several disciplines namely: statistics, computer science, machine learning, scientific research and business knowledge. You don't have to be an Expert in all of these areas. You have to know the basics and be able to learn to update regularly. Data Science is the process of using data to understand the world, answer questions, make predictions and make recommendations. While technical skills such as statistics and IT are very important, business knowledge is what sets the best Data Scientists apart. Indeed, given that the Data Scientist intervenes in a specific field, he must have knowledge of the type of business in which he operates.</p>
              <p>The demand for qualified Data Scientists is growing, but the supply is low. You therefore have the opportunity to earn a good living by being a Data Scientist. You just need to train yourself. You can learn through this website, the books of the author Josué Afouda. We strive to produce quality educational resources in Data Science that are accessible to all. The best way to encourage us in this noble mission is to buy and recommend our products and services.</p>

    <p class="lead">Overall, experts distinguish two types of Artificial Intelligence: weak AI and strong or generalized AI. <a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordionTwo" href="#collapseTwo">Read more&hellip;</a></p>
     <div class="panel-group transparent-panel-group" id="accordionTwo">

              <p>The so-called Weak AI is the type of Artificial Intelligence where the progress is the most considerable and concrete. It is the AI that can perform specific tasks in specific areas by making decisions based on algorithms driven by data. Weak AI therefore performs a specific task. Some of the things that weak AI can do to date include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</li>
                <li>Face detection</li>
                <li>Image recognition</li>
                <li>recommendation systems</li>
              </ul>
              <p>How can weak AI accomplish these tasks? Most of it is through Machine Learning. Machine Learning is a set of tools that give machines the ability to learn to perform a task without being explicitly programmed to do so.</p>
              <p>The second form of Artificial Intelligence is the so-called strong or generalized one. Strong AI is Artificial Intelligence capable of doing everything a human being can do and of performing many diverse and varied tasks at the same time. Strong AI can teach itself new strategies to solve new problems at a human intelligence level. It is a field of Artificial Intelligence with little progress but which remains a vast and exciting field of research for the specialists who work there.</p>
              <p>In the remainder of this article, the term Artificial Intelligence is equated with weak AI. AI impacts all aspects of our daily lives. Let’s now see some examples and areas of application of Artificial Intelligence:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Computer vision: In this field, we find examples of AI such as self-driving cars, facial recognition, detection of objects and entities in images.</li>
                <li>Natural Language Processing: Technologies in this area of AI application aim to empower machines to understand human language. There are examples such as translation systems like Google Translate, voice recognition, intelligent assistants like Cortana and Alexa, chatbots.</li>
                <li>Recommendation engines: For example, Netflix uses a recommendation system to offer movies to its subscribers. Amazon also uses a recommendation system to suggest items to buy from its site. With their recommendation systems, social networks like Facebook suggest people with whom we can connect to expand our network.</li>
              </ul>
