- **Data Integration**: Fetches real-time stock market data using the `quantmod` package and integrates seamlessly with Yahoo Finance.
- **Visualization Tools**:
  - Line charts for stock prices or returns with moving averages.
  - Boxplots and histograms for statistical insights.
  - Advanced technical charts with Bollinger Bands, RSI, EMA, and MACD indicators.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Options for:
  - Selecting a stock index and asset.
  - Specifying a date range for analysis.
  - Setting short and long moving averages.
  - Viewing raw data tables with adjustable row limits.
- **Downloadable Data**: Export stock data as CSV, Excel, or PDF directly from the app.

1. **R Shiny Development**:
   - Designed an interactive application using modular `ui` and `server` components.
   - Leveraged reactive programming for dynamic updates and user-driven inputs.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Created visually appealing and interactive charts using `ggplot2`, `plotly`, and `quantmod`.
   - Enhanced user experience with customizable chart features and parameters.

3. **Technical Analysis Expertise**:
   - Implemented key technical indicators such as Bollinger Bands, RSI, EMA, and MACD.
   - Enabled in-depth analysis of stock market data.

4. **Integration with Financial APIs**:
   - Accessed and processed live data from Yahoo Finance using the `getSymbols` function.

5. **Dashboard Design**:
   - Built an elegant layout using `shinydashboard` with cohesive styling and intuitive navigation.

## Application Structure
### User Interface (UI)
The UI is designed with:
- **Dashboard Menu**: Organized into tabs for seamless navigation.
- **Input Panels**: Interactive widgets for user input, including dropdown menus, sliders, and action buttons.
- **Output Displays**: A combination of `plotly` charts, `datatable` tables, and advanced plots for technical analysis.

### Server Logic
The server logic processes user inputs and dynamically updates outputs. Key components include:
- Reactive expressions to handle data filtering and transformations.
- Event-driven outputs for rendering plots and tables.
- Conditional panels for optional data displays.

## How to Use
1. **Select a Stock Market Index**:
   Choose from CAC 40, S&P 500, DAX, FTSE 100, or Nikkei 225.

2. **Select a Stock**:
   Use the dropdown menu to choose an asset within the selected index.

3. **Specify Analysis Parameters**:
   - Set the date range for the analysis.
   - Choose to analyze either price or return data.
   - Adjust the short and long moving average parameters.

4. **View Results**:
   - Explore line charts, boxplots, and histograms.
   - Enable the data table display for raw stock data.

5. **Export Data**:
   Download the stock data in various formats using the export buttons.
