# RShiny Portfolio Dashboard

![myrshinyportfolio](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83fb8002-fb76-4f8c-a2f9-acec3ca0c9d7)

Welcome to my **RShiny Portfolio**, an advanced, multi-application dashboard built with the **shinydashboard** framework. This project is designed to showcase my expertise in developing scalable and impactful data-driven applications using R. Each menu represents a standalone application or dashboard, meticulously crafted to provide interactive and insightful solutions for various domains.

## ðŸš€ **Project Structure**

The project is organized into a modular structure for enhanced scalability and maintainability:

```
- data/                 # Data files used across applications
- ui/                   # Contains UI scripts for individual apps (e.g., pharma_forecasting_ui.R)
- server/               # Contains server scripts for individual apps (e.g., pharma_forecasting_server.R)
- functions/            # Contains helper functions (e.g., pharma_forecasting_function.R)
- readme/               # Individual README files for each app
- global.R              # Entry point for the entire application
- utils.R               # Utility functions shared across the portfolio
```

Dependency management is handled using the **`renv`** package, ensuring a reproducible environment.
